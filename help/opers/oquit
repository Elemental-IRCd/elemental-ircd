OQUIT :[message]

OQUIT is the same as normal QUIT, in that it sends a message to the IRC daemon
letting it know that you would like to disconnect with the given message.
The key differences between QUIT and OQUIT are that firstly only IRC operators
can use OQUIT, and secondly that when OQUIT is used, the IRC daemon will not
prefix the quit message with "Quit: ". This allows IRC operators to "spoof"
quit messages for themselves, such as ping timeouts or netsplits.
