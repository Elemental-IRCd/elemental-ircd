Some Elemental-IRCd features are modeled after or direct ports of
code from Charybdis.

ShadowIRCd 6 was a modern restart of the old ShadowIRCd project
based on Charybdis with a few additional features to make it appeal
more to more users. We try to work as closely as possible with the
Charybdis team.

RESTART, DIE and MOD* commands were borrowed from ircd-seven.

Charybdis started as an evolution from ircd-ratbox. Its development
is led by a team of dedicated developers who have put a lot of time
into the project, and it has seen use on a variety of different
network configurations.
