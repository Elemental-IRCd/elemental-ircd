 *            structure (with an open socket connected!). This
 *            identifies the physical socket where the message

 *            executed--some m_functions may call others...).

 *                    user (not local).
 *
 *
 *            combining

 *            *cannot* be a local connection, unless it's
 *            actually client_p!). [MyConnect(x) should probably
