# Documentation Tree

This folder is the "attic" of the project. Things of historical significance, 
technical interest, or example configuration files will live in here.

## `historical`

This subfolder contains things that are of universal historical interest to 
keep around.

## `technical`

Anything in here should probably be moved to the github wiki if it is decently 
relevant.

---

If there is anything in here about support for things that are really old or 
otherwise obsolete, please feel free to let us know so we can get rid of it.
